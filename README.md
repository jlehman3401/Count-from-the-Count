# Count-from-the-Count

This Python program generate a random number between 1 and 20 and then prints out the counting up to 
that randomly selected number, while occasionally adding a laughing sound (Ah Ah Ah) and this is to 
mimick the counting and laughing of the character, The Count, from the PBS show Sesame Street.
